# Open4D
Open4D exists to 1.) implement 4D effects in my local movie theater (Fremont Cinemas) for my customers to enjoy, 2.) make 4D an affordable option for movie theaters across the world wanting to increase their relevance and add to their customers' experience, and 3.) incentivize the future development and release of 4D films.
